# Azure Hub-Spoke Infrastructure with Private Link

This project implements a secure hub-and-spoke network architecture across multiple Azure subscriptions with centralized private DNS management.

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

![Subscription Structure](docs/images/subscriptions.png)

- **Hub (Work_Subscription_A)**: Centralized networking and DNS management
- **Spoke (Spoke_1)**: Workload subscriptions with VMs and storage
- **Cross-subscription VNet peering** for secure connectivity
- **Centralized private DNS zones** in hub for Azure services
- **Azure policies** preventing privatelink DNS zones in spokes

## Prerequisites

1. Azure CLI installed and configured
2. Terraform >= 1.0
3. Appropriate permissions in both subscriptions
4. Service Principal with cross-subscription access

##  ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Deploy Hub Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd environments/hub
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy Spoke Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd environments/spoke-1
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Test VM Storage Access**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-storage-access.sh
   ```
